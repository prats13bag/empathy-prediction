### 1. Problem Statement
Using the [Young People Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/), predict a person’s “Empathy” as either “very empathetic” (answers 4 and 5) or “not very empathetic” (answers 1, 2, and 3).

### 2. Software Requirements
  - Jupyter Notebook 
  - Python 3.6 or later
  
### 3. Dependencies
  - scikit-learn 0.20.0
  - numpy 1.15.3
  - pandas 0.23.4
  - matplotlib 3.0.1

### 4. Execution Steps

    A. using python shell

        1. Navigate to the directory where the project is cloned
        2. Issue python train.py (skip this step to directly load & test the model)
        3. Issue python test.py

    B. using jupyter notebook

        - To Train & Test, run each cell of the notebook in sequential order
        - To Test only, locate "Unpickle to predict" in the notebook and run cells following that.
